# User-Management App

 This project is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) User Management website built to help manage CRUD operations on users. I have used JSONPlaceholder's users data for this website.

## Features

- The user can do basic CRUD operations on existing users data like edit, add, delete, search a user data.
- We can use filters, sort and search options to get the required data.
- **NOTE**: Because of the limitation of using JASONPlaceholder's users data, we can't update changes but It does show success by providing a success code on successful completion of task.
